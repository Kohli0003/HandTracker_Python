# Hand Gesture Controlled Mouse using Python

This project enables controlling the mouse cursor using hand gestures captured through the device's camera. It utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and track the user's hand movements, translating them into corresponding mouse actions.

## Features

1. Hand Detection: The system employs computer vision algorithms to detect the user's hand in real-time from the camera feed.

2. Gesture Recognition: It recognizes predefined hand gestures, such as open palm, closed fist, pointing finger, etc., to trigger specific mouse actions.

3. Mouse Control: The detected hand gestures are translated into mouse movements (cursor position) and mouse clicks, providing seamless control over the computer's mouse pointer.

4. Cross-platform Compatibility: The system is implemented using Python and compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.


## Requirements

1. #### Python 3.x

2. #### OpenCV: 
[OpenCV](https://vovkos.github.io/doxyrest-showcase/opencv/sphinx_rtd_theme/index.html) (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.

3. #### Media Pipe: 
[MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/guide) is an open-source framework developed by Google Research that offers ready-to-use machine learning solutions for various perception tasks.

 #### Key Features:

Pre-built Models: MediaPipe offers a collection of pre-trained models for tasks such as hand tracking, pose estimation, face detection, and object detection.

In this Project we have used the Hand Model you can find the documentation here [Documentation](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/docs/solutions/hands.md)

4. #### PyAutoGUI 
[PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python library that provides cross-platform support for controlling the mouse and keyboard, as well as capturing screen images. It allows developers to automate GUI interactions, simulate user input, and create desktop automation scripts.
